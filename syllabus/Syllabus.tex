\section*{Course Description}

This course investigates how to use digitized texts -- news articles, speeches, laws, press releases, party manifestos/platforms, transcripts, open-ended surveys, Tweets, etc. -- as sources of data for social science research.

We begin with overviews of the ``text as data'' field in political science -- which is heavily influenced by computer science branch of natural language processing (NLP). The idea is to get you data as a poor graduate student for free that you can then use in your own research to answer questions of theoretical interest.

We then discuss theory/mechanics of converting text into data. This will include topics like preprocessing text and related NLP tasks (e.g., stemming, tokenizing) and representing text as data (e.g., bag-of-words, measures of association), etc. Text data is often ``messy'' so handling that will be a large part of this course (e.g., web scraping, file encodings, file formats, extracting only relevant text from strings, etc.).

We'll then turn to the major approaches to measuring social science concepts with textual data, including rule-based methods, supervised learning from human-coded or known examples, and un-supervised methods. As we go, we will discuss particular measurement objectives like classification, scaling, topic modeling, and analysis of sentiment and stance, as well as ways of validating our models. 

Depending on time, student interest and capacity, we may learn about the neural network / deep learning approach that has come to dominate NLP in recent years.

The course will assume students have some graduate level work in statistical inference, quantitative social science methodology, or machine learning, and at least know what R is but ideally some experience with R.

\section*{Course Policies}

\subsection*{During Class}
\footnotesize{Log in on time. The first 5-10 minutes we might do some sort of ``ice-breaker'' just to get it rolling in the zoom land. Ask questions whenever you have them and I will try to answer as best I can. I will often have code and data available in advance. So go to the course website and download anything in advance of each class.}

\subsection*{Attendance Policy}
\footnotesize{Attendance is expected in all classes. Valid excuses for absence will be accepted before class, please just email me in advance.}

\subsection*{Policies on Incomplete Grades and Late Assignments}
\footnotesize{If throughout the quarter you suspect you will not be able to complete the course or hand in all the material, please discuss the possibility of an Incomplete with me. Turn all assignments in on time before the class starts. Extensions may be granted in extenuating circumstances.}

\subsection*{Academic Integrity and Honesty}
\footnotesize{Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity. In effect, in this class, for all papers and research designs you generate, while your work can be based on others', the content must be solely yours.}

\subsection*{Accommodations for Disabilities}
\footnotesize{Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Services Office and let me know in advance.}

\footnotesize{Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited.}

\newpage
\section*{Schedule and weekly learning goals}

The schedule is tentative and subject to change. The learning goals below should be viewed as the key concepts and code you should grasp after each week, and also as a study guide before each exam, and at the end of the semester. Each exam will test on the material that was taught up until 1 week prior to the exam (i.e. vorticity will not be tested until exam 2). The applications in the second half of the semester tend to build on the concepts in the first half of the semester though, so it is still important to at least review those concepts throughout the semester.
